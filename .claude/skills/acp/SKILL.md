# Add, Commit, and Push

Automates the full add-commit-push-deploy workflow. This goes beyond just committing — it pushes to origin and monitors the deployment pipeline.

## Step 1: Clean Up

Before staging anything, clean up artifacts from the current session:

- Delete any temporary scripts, scratch files, or generated artifacts created during this session
- Add any files that should be kept but never checked in to `.gitignore`

## Step 2: Review and Stage

Run `git status` and `git diff` to understand all changes.

- Never stage sensitive files (`.env`, credentials, API keys, secrets)
- Stage files by name — do not use `git add -A` or `git add .`
- If something looks wrong or unexpected, ask the user before proceeding

## Step 3: Run Tests

Run tests before committing to catch issues early:

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

If tests fail, diagnose the root cause and fix the actual code (never weaken the test). Do not proceed until tests pass.

## Step 4: Commit

Write a concise commit message that explains the *why*, not just the *what*:

- Subject line: imperative mood, max 50 chars, no period
- Body (if needed): blank line after subject, wrap at 72 chars
- End with the co-author line

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
Subject line here

Optional body explaining why.

)"
```

If the pre-commit hook fails:
1. Fix the underlying code (not the tests)
2. Re-stage the fixes
3. Create a NEW commit — do not amend
4. Repeat until the commit succeeds

## Step 5: Push

All work is done on `main`. Push directly:

```bash
git push origin main
```

After pushing, verify `git status` shows a clean working tree.

## Step 6: Monitor Deployment

After pushing, watch the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Find the triggered workflow run:
   ```bash
   gh run list --branch main --limit 5
   ```

2. Watch the run:
   ```bash
   gh run watch <run-id>
   ```

3. If the deployment fails, investigate:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
   ```
   Then fix the issue and start the workflow over from Step 2.

## Important Notes

- Do NOT use `--no-verify` to bypass hooks
- Do NOT weaken tests to make them pass — fix the actual bugs
- Do NOT amend commits that have already been pushed
- If anything looks risky or unexpected, ask the user before proceeding
