//! `CameraDrag` — the viewport's left/right/middle-button drag state
//! machine. Extracted from `viewport_widget.rs` so that file stays
//! under the repository's 800-line guardrail as new gizmo drag variants
//! land (each control gizmo adds a variant + its per-frame fields).
//!
//! The state transitions live in
//! `viewport_widget/viewport_widget_interactions.rs` (`on_mouse_down` /
//! `on_mouse_move` / `on_mouse_up`); the per-frame drag math lives in
//! `viewport_widget/body_drag.rs`. This module only declares the shape
//! of the state each variant carries.
